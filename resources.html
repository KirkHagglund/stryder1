                  This is one of my favourite videos that are using all of my
                  one-on-one coaching. Leading with questions, every leader should
                  have this as one of their top five tools in their leadership tool
                  kit. To be effective at it, one must be strategic, listen, provide
                  clarity of job roles, and practice effective communication all the
                  time.

                  Did you know our tone and how we put words and phrases together
                  when we speak can directly impact our credibility with others.
                  Paying attention to my tone and the words and phrases has improved
                  my influence and executive presence. Getting others to buy-in and

                Of the many qualities that made Caesar a great leader, perhaps
                none were more important than his proficiency as a strategist.
                In both military and political matters, Caesar's strategies
                proved effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                One such strategy, divide and conquer, was made famous by Caesar
                while fighting the Gallic Wars. Also during this war came one of
                Caesars greatest challenges and triumphs in the form of the 52BC
                siege of Alesia. Defending this nearly impregnable Gallic
                stronghold was Vercingetorix, the leader of the Gallic
                Confederacy, at the head of 80,000 warriors. Caesar quickly
                implemented his plan to capture the city and began construction
                of siege works. Caesar planned to build a wall encircling the
                town, which would be defended by towers, battlements, and
                trenches. When completed the wall extended 10 miles, and formed
                a ring around Alesia.

              <p>
                However, before it was fully finished, Vercingetorix sent out
                riders to gather reinforcements from the tribes of Gaul. Caesar
                immediately ordered the construction of a second wall, meant to
                defend against the reinforcements that would soon arrive. This
                exterior wall formed a 14-mile barrier, and was strengthened
                with towers, traps, pits, and two large trenches. Caesar had the
                inner trench filled with water diverted from nearby streams.
                Knowing that when reinforcements arrived his troops would be
                unable to forage, Caesar had each man gather enough food to last
                a month.

              <p>
                Alas, Vercingetorix's plea was answered and 260,000 Gauls
                arrived to put Caesars plan to the test. With this large army,
                the Gallic forces now outnumbered the Romans 4 to 1. While
                simultaneously defending multiple fronts Caesars army managed to
                stave off the perpetual onslaught of the two armies which were
                fighting desperately to force a passage through the Roman
                defenses. Caesar waited patiently for the opportune moment to
                counter the reinforcing army and when the opportunity presented
                itself. he ordered the attack and sent his cavalry out to flank
                the enemy and deliver the decisive blow.

              <p>
                Devastated and panic stricken, the supporting army fled the
                field of battle, pursued by Caesar's cavalry. As the remnants of
                his army lay in ruin, completely surrounded and with no hope of
                further aid, Veringetorix issued his surrender and acknowledged
                Roman rule.
              </p>
              <p>
                By way of superior strategy and discipline, a smaller army had
                bested a much larger force and although Caesar's career was far
                from over, the conquest of Gaul was nearly complete.
